JHanson,5,This little projector is amazing!  After you unlock the full Google experience! Takes 5 minutes.,545,"This little projector is amazing!  With the help of Adam at Anker I had the google app store up and running in 5 minutes.  Now, this thing is a full functioning android projector!  Go to ABOUT in the settings menu and CLICK ON THE ANDROID VERSION 5 TIMES in a row.  A password window comes up, input a password you must obtain from Anker...... then click DONE and OK.  You will be presented with a new download.  Say yes and download it. After it finishes it will reboot.  When it reboots you will have full google apps including the google play store.  To access the play store go to APP MANAGER on the home menu and you will see the play store and all the other google apps.  This addition made the capsule a truly amazing device!  Anker customer support is great.  Adam was very helpful and they answer the phone right away.",25/05/2018
T Wang,5,can sit nicely on most surfaces and also comes with a standard ...,464,"This is a revolutionary product --- a very usable portable projector. It is decently bright; can work for hours on battery; can sit nicely on most surfaces and also comes with a standard tripod screw hole. It comes with Android 7.1, so it works as a portable smart TV on its own. It can also mirror screens of cell phones (I tested both IOS and android) and computers through wifi and bluetooth. Therefore, it has a very convenient and truly wireless setup. There is simply no other non-Anker/Nebula portable projector available today (Jan 2018) in its league.The only projector worthy of comparison is the Nebula Mars. For not too much more money (especially when Mars has a discount), you get 500 ANSI Lumens vs 100, 1280x800 resolution vs 854x480, 19500mAh battery vs 5200mAh, 10W JBL speakers vs 5W unknown speakers. So Mars seems like a better deal. However, I simply cannot get over the portability of Capsule. In my mind, this single factor outweighs all the rest of them. Moreover, Capsule runs Android 7.1 now an...",11/01/2018
Kindle Customer,2,"Great hardware, but software doesn't work.  Do not buy unless you want to project from HDMI source only.",894,"I very rarely write reviews on Amazon, but I feel compelled to write a review for this product because there is relatively little public information online about it.  From an engineering perspective, the device is amazing - it's small and powerful, with good brightness for its size.  And if all you want to do is plug in an HDMI cable and project, you'll be happy.  However, to me, the real promise of this device was that it runs Android and should be able to operate entirely wirelessly via apps or casting, and these functions simply do not work.  Here's the deal:The Nebula Capsule does indeed run Android, but it doesn't have Google Play and most apps that you'd want to use are either not available or do not work.  For example, I was trying to watch the Olympics and the NBC Olympics app wouldn't install because Play Services aren't available.  NBC Sports installs ok but doesn't work because it needs the user to log in via a web browser and the Nebula doesn't have a browser.  The story was pretty much the sam...",03/03/2018
Amb2020,5,Amazing little device,280,"This will save you a lot of research... I'll address some of the ""pitfalls"" that others have mentioned in their initial reviews first and then will tell you how much I like this device.- Limited App store: I found this to be the case at first, but with help from an awesome Nebula representative named Ashley, there's a very simple workaround and YOU CAN DOWNLOAD MOST APPS.  Go to APKpure.com and download the android app installers to a thumb drive. Then plug the thumb drive into the capsule and install the apps.  It's really simple and I wasn't sketched out by the process (I'm pretty hesitant to download things from unknown sources) and it worked like a charm.  I now have Sling TV, HBO Go, Showtime Anytime, and most of the apps I couldn't download from the native store. Took me about 20 minutes to find, download, and install all of the apps I wanted.- Brightness: it's really pretty impressive.  You have to consider that this thing is the size of a soda can... You don't need the room to be super dark to get ...",14/05/2018

Ethi Chaudhary,5,Its perfect! The sound,160,"Its perfect! The sound, picture, connections, everything!- gives a large, crisp, bright image even in semi-darkness,- has EXCELLENT in-built speakers (which can be used as only speakers without the projector too!),- wifi connectivity makes netflix, amazon, youtube etc connections really easy (do note you cannot sign in to your youtube account from it, but you can always use phone mirroring for that)- the phone app can be used as remote for the projector : phone literally becomes a touch pad for the projector control (super handy!!)- connects very easily to phone- charges with a simple regular USB cable (haven't tried connecting my laptop to it so can't comment on that)I looked around A LOT before finalizing this projector and am really happy with the decision.Just in case you are interested, below is a list of pointers I had created for the several projectors I looked at:toumei mini pico c800w- internal 8gb storage- can run for 2 hours without connected charging- good remote- has bluetooth and wifi- can mi...",09/07/2018
Poppy Seaberry,3,"I’m keeping it, but...",159,"The stripped-down version of Android is a real bummer, I must say. Kills the potential of this projector. It’s still better than all the other mini models, but it also costs a lot more, too, so I was hoping for more.The good:* Picture is bright enough in a dim room and great in a dark room. My walls are beige, not white, and it performs fine without a screen. I’m getting a screen soon, so I’ll update when I do. It’s still a mini projector, and portability is going to come with compromise.* I like the form factor. It fits nicely in a case made for the Amazon Tap speaker; it’s shorter than the speaker but about the same width, so I got that case and put in a bit of springy foam as support. There’s room for the power cord, also, though not the remote. (This $7 hack was better than the $40 case made for the Nebula.)* Sound is impressive for a small speaker that’s more than a speaker. It’s as loud as my Anker SoundCore, which is loud enough for my needs. Won’t fill a large room, but is perfectly serviceable for...",26/04/2018
dfa1234,5,"great quality, easy to use & stream from various apps",85,"This projector is awesome! My husband got it for me for Christmas I was nervous because I have a lot of Apple products and I am not used to android but so far it's been super easy to use and compatible with my iphone and airplay and mirroring. I have also hooked my phone up with a hdmi/lightening adapter but don't really notice a difference in quality I think streaming and hardwiring are both great. I set up netflix, youtube, and the dish anywhere app right on the device and stream easily with no issues although I do use the nebula connect app on my phone as a remote for netflix and dish. I think the quality is not much different than my high def 1080p TV. My kids are all obsessed with watching movies on the every wall in our house now , it works well in all of our neutral painted rooms and pretty good on my sons dark blue walls in his room. We also use it in bed on the ceilings. I can't fit a TV anywhere in our kitchen so now i can set it up and project it pretty much anywhere in there. The speakers work ...",02/01/2019

rangeriffic,1,It doesn’t work on most formats.,46,"The projector will play Netflix off it’s native application using your phone as a hotspot.The projector will work with a direct line HDMI to a gaming console or disc player. The end.It implies that it will mirror different devices. That is true: VIA WiFi! It will not mirror via Bluetooth or direct line HDMI. It does not have common video applications like Hulu.Bottom Line:Are you buying it so you can pack your gaming console but not your TV? => BuyAre you buying it so you can watch Netflix (and only Netflix) on a larger screen utilizing your hotspot enabled smartphone? => BuyAre you hoping it will save you from packing a work monitor for you computer through the HDMI port? => Do not buy.

BH,1,Needs to be brighter,63,"I got this projector due to being compact and having built in speaker.  The con is that you can only use in pitch black room, as it isn’t very bright.  I tried in room with blinds and the light from blinds just allows too much light.",24/06/2018
Rebecca M,5,Amazing projector for the price. Tons of fun,44,"We have had the Nebula Capsulefor about two months now and absolutely love it. We downloaded Netflix to the capsule and were then able to download shows from Netflix to the capsule.  We put the nebula capsule in our mini van on a tripod and placed it on the floor and th kids were able to watch all of their Netflix shows while on our road trip. It made for a much happier ride for the kids.Also, we had lost the remote. I emailed Nebula capsule customer service to purchase anew remote and they sent me one for free.My wife and I also found a lot of enjoyment out of this capsule. I downloaded our favorite movie “Forgetting Sarah Marshall”on to the Netflix app on the capsule and we watched it in our hotel room wall at about 10 feet in size.So much fun and a great device. Great sound and great picture for something so small. This is the first review I have ever written on amazon and it’s because this is such a good buy.",10/07/2018
Buddhagem,5,Amazing device that does EVERYTHING!,40,"This mini projector is simply amazing. The size is the first thing that grabs your attention. This thing is tiny. It’s the size of a soda can. So I was skeptical that the images would be very good. Boy was I wrong! The sun hadn’t even went down yet and we were playing it out on our terrace and the image was still bright and vibrant. The ability to download apps like NetFlix, Amazon Prime and Plex is huge! Within minutes I had my entire Plex library at my fingertips. The companion Capsule App for IOS works great. The standard remote is fine but with the app I don’t have to worry about bringing one more thing. The speaker is fine but we typically hook it up to one of our larger Bluetooth speakers for more robust sound.Last night I took it in the bedroom and watched a movie on our ceiling with the sound pumped in to my airpods. The picture was amazing even just projecting it onto a white ceiling. From our bed up to the ceiling I still had a 50” screen. It was so fun!This thing is great. You can download just ...",22/07/2018
Eric in New Mexico,4,"Compared to the WOWOTO T8e, Nebula made a great set of compromises on a truly portable device",83,"After comparison to the WOWOTO T8E: Bumping up one star.  I wish I could settle at say, 3.75 stars.  I really want a bit more ANSI lumens (200 would be solid); and 720P.  But Anker/Nebula clearly balanced a lot of choices in the design here.  Internal apps also need work, and we need Google Play Services stat.  I also think Netflix needs a tweak to support higher resolution streaming as it seems to settle on 480p and lower bitrate than I'd like and I find connecting my phone via HDMI results in a better Netflix experience.Overall I'm sticking with the Nebula Capsule over the T8e.  My reasons being:1) Fan noise on the T8e is way too annoying2) T8e has a terrible internal speaker, and using a BT speaker is a huge problem because of a .5s-1s audio delay3) No smartphone app for control - this is the the best part of the Nebula Capsule as the smartphone app is excellent.  I hated using the touchpad on the top of the T8e.4) <2 hours Battery life on the T8e means you will likely always need to plug in during a fu...",26/01/2018
amazonian,1,"2 weeks, 7 etc support calls and  $76 worth of hdmi cables and connectors but still doesn’t work.",16,"Mine had a ton of problems. I called customer support about 5 times and ultimately couldn’t get it to work. When I clicked on Netflix on the home screen it would neither download Netflix nor play Netflix. So I called and they gave me a work around, a google play password to download the google store. I did that only to find that there was no enter button. Not on the remote or on the iPhone nebula connect app. So I called again and they told me to hold down the mouse button on the remote until I got a pointing hand cursor which I could use my remote arrows to navigate around. Finally I could scroll down enough to get to the enter button. Success!  Google play store finally downloaded. A series of steps was completed and I restarted after the install. Now I went to try to download Netflix. I typed netflix in the search window but Netflix didn’t appear. So I couldn’t download the app. Giving up on that, I tried to download amazon prime from the google play app because that’s the other way I watch movies. Well...",07/10/2019
Sandro,5,Excellent so far...,22,"Been using it for a week so far and i’m pretty happy with it. size is small but has a nice weight to it. well built. it is bright enough even with some lights on. User interface is very easy to use and navigate. Remote is decent enough but would have been so much better if they used bluetooth, as it is it needs line of sight in order to work but they do have a phone app available for iphone and android. would have like to see more i/o ports. only has one micro usb to charge and a full size HDMI. All in all this is a great little projector to use ANYWHERE, but specially when traveling on vacation or camping. it projects a good picture even on a gray wall 5 feet away. the speaker is so much better than any other Pico projectors, personally I have tried 4 others with similar form factor. this is not a bose speaker but it is very good to watch any movie. not much of a bass but i’m sure it is phisically impossible to get anything better in such small space. I also looked at getting at their own nebula protectiv...",28/04/2018
Jay Pinks,3,A Good Attempt but Needs Improvement,15,"I purchased the Nebula Capsule Smart Mini Projector as a gift so I can not review it for long term use.I inspected the projector to ensure it works because it is going to family overseas and can not easily be exchanged if needed.  I am happy I did this because there was a small problem with the remote.  The battery door was broken and would not stay in place.  Anker contacted me directly via email to ask about the purchase and when I informed them of the problem they had a new remote to me in 3 days.  I am always impressed with Anker's customer service.I attached the Nebula Capsule to a camera tripod and found it fit perfectly.It powered on with an almost full charge out of the box.  The one I purchased is black and it has a slick look.  As described it is similar in size and weight to a can of soda.The material quality is top-notch.  The casing feels like it is built to last, mostly of metal.The size makes it very portable.  I paired it with a hard-shell travel case for safer transportation.It comes with ...",31/03/2019

Stephanie Zahn,4,Great now that I have google play!,5,"We had a rough beginning but I finally love it! I could not for the life of me get my note 9 to screencast, without a 3rd party app called ""castto"". The problem is, it froze so much. I use this to stream peloton workouts so it was super frustrating when it would freeze for a good 2-3 minutes, multiple times, during workouts. I was not sure if it was the casting app or the Nebula that was freezing. I finally got around to calling Nebula, to get the password to install google play, so I could just download the app I wanted instead of screen casting. Like the other reviewer said, to get google play you need to: Go to ABOUT in the settings menu and CLICK ON THE ANDROID VERSION 5 TIMES in a row. A password window comes up, input gmstest1221 (all lower case, no spaces) then click DONE and it'll let you install. The device will need to reboot.After I got google play, I took my workout class and experienced NO freezing. So it seems to be the casting app I was using. Nebula really should consider selling the device...",27/12/2019
Samuel Lee,3,"Lovely outside, but the guts on this unit leaves something to be desired.",9,"Out of the box the unit itself is a solid piece of hardware, well constructed, metal grill over the speakers and a thick chasis that looks like it can take a fall or two without hurting the unit itself, the lens is recessed far enough that it won't get scratched easily but for that extra layer of protection a small bag is included with the packaging.So that's the good... what about the bad?The operating system being Android 7.1 is fine but even with the basic apps (youtube, netflix, opera browser) I've already taken up over half of the built in memory. That doesn't leave much room for videos etc. While the usb port may be used for expanded memory (although one raises the issue on how you would charge the unit) the fact that you don't have a micro sd slot seems like a poor design decision.As far as apps are concerned Youtube is problematic because I can't seem to login to my youtube account despite me pressing the ""login"" button many times it just doesn't respond.

Every time i tried it crashed.- This device is severely lacking inputs. Other models out there have more inputs- The remote control is absurdly finicky, you have to aim it right behind the projector and if you don't your input wont register....- No Google Play Store?!?!??!

GodsReapingSoldier,1,It must be unlocked...,5,It is locked so none of the apps work. You can not even sign into Youtube. Lol!  You can not even screen share and run apps through your phone the device detects it and crashes your connection in order to stop you from using apps.

joe cabello,4,Tested in home and outdoors for groups,2,"I've used this to screen outdoor movies and it was plenty bright with good picture. You can get better picture quality from cheaper projectors, but the convenience factor is just too good. I went from watching a movie in on room to the other with no set up needed.  I just moved my tripod from one room to the other. If it wasn't so convenient, I'd never use it. Since it is, I use it constantly.The included software does the job, though some apps require you to use your phone as a remote.If the price is egregious to you but you still want portability, I would suggest investing in a cheaper projector but also get a stand and a mount. You're probably looking at spending about the same at that point.Cons:Sound - the speakers are loud enough, but they are tinny. It does NOT have aux hook up, so you'll have to rely on Bluetooth. I found there to be some lag with the bluetooth though. There is a way around this. Instead of connecting to the projector to the bluetooth speaker, connect the DEVICE to the bluetooth sp...",22/06/2020
Jesse,5,A little projector that packs a punch!,56,"Bought this for my wife for her birthday. She wanted a projector in the bedroom to cast upon the ceiling. I was all over getting this for her! After doing research and looking at a lot of different mini projectors, nothing even came close to the awesomeness that this thing portrayed. When it arrived and we got it all hooked up and running, we weren't disappointed in the slightest. We purchased the tripod stand with it and it does exactly what we wanted it to do.While the ceiling isn't the best projection surface (it's a textured ceiling), it still worked great. We have since moved it to project across our wall and boy does it take up the whole dang thing! Of course, you're not going to get be getting 1080p quality with a device this small and compact, but it's still more than watchable.

Safari Man,5,My  favorite LED projector by far! Ticks all the boxes.,4,"I bought this Nebula Capsule for a trip to South America to visit family (to show home movies and pictures). It is about the same size as a can of coke, so it is small, but boy does it pack a punch. All of the other projectors I have used were shaped like smartphones, so I was a bit thrown off by the shape of the Nebula. But let me just tell you right now, this can shape is great! I really can't say there is anything I did not like about this unit when it comes to the major features. It just ticked all the boxes. They got a lot of things right on this unit.Things is really liked.1. Great Speakers!The main thing that was wrong on the other four units I have used was the speakers, which were all but useless. That is not the case with this Nebula. I showed videos to groups to over 30 people in an outdoor setting and no one had any trouble hearing clearly.

Immediately we opened it up and tested it out with a dreamworks film for the kids...JUST WOW! The fact there is an almost full charge out of the box was amazing, the picture quality was really impressive even with the light spilling into the room from another room. The brightness and color seemed pretty accurate. The sound is pretty loud, no need to turn it all the way up and the 360 speaker is awesome, no wondering if it is reaching all sides of the audience.  The fact you can download apps to stream and run everything off your phone, completely cordless is such a huge advantage over the other mini projectors!!

Amazon_Shop_3920777,4,Nice hardware design but user experience is terrible,6,"Bought this for it's portability and ease of use through WiFi and streaming applications. Was easy to set-up and the quality is good. However, the negative outweighs the positive for me. When streaming, it goes to sleep every 30 min or so. I have to remember to move the mouse which ruins the experience. If there's a setting to change this, I can't find it in all the menus I've sorted through. Searched online for a solution and nothing was helpful. Just opening a show on Netflix is a nightmare. Even using the Nebula Connect app is painful for scrolling. Usually need to close out the Netflix app completely and open it again. Would not recommend this.UPDATE: Anker customer support is really superb.

robert clee,1,Terrible Software and Barely Usable!!,2,"I was really excited for this to show up with the NFL Championship games coming up this weekend. I have AT&T TV for live television which is available on my Roku, Amazon Fire and pretty much every other device. The Nebula loaded software is just flat out terrible!! AT&T TV is not available and cannot be projected via Airplay. I know I can use an HDMI from my iPhone but for me that completely defeats the purpose of buying an expensive PORTABLE projector.Netflix and Disney+ using the AppToid software requires the Nebula app vs the provided remote. I prefer a remote, Roku and Fire TV UI work well with their remotes and that is the experience I am looking for.Sound is great, video is more than good enough but not full HD. However, the UI is so bad I am going to return it!My recommendation is if this can be upgraded to Android TV 9.x than its worth it, if you not and you are stuck with AppToid than I would say ""Do not buy!'",21/01/2021

You can't set the system up without a phone app even though it looks like there are controls for it on the device.  The iPhone app interface is clumsy and the touch control doesn't work well.  The UI screen flow is incomprehensible.  We couldn't get the iPhone display to project and when we tried to download the device's Netflix, etc. apps to project shows that way; the installs always failed with ""Unexpected error"".  It even took quite a bit of playing to get the PC display to project.  I probably could have played with it, bought more cables and gotten everything to eventually work but this was a present for someone who is not technically savvy and gets frustrated getting techy stuff to work.

Brian,5,"Well thought-out, high-quality",,"Every time I use this projector, I like it more. The build quality feels really solid, the picture quality is better than I expected, if a little low on contrast, and the sound quality is good. At first I was hesitant to download yet another app to my phone just for controlling it, since the included remote control works well. But I will admit that once I caved and downloaded the remote control app, it's well-designed and very functional. I've also used AirPlay to mirror my screen to the Nebula, to watch video from a different app, and that worked seamlessly. So far the 4-hour playback time has been pretty accurate and reliable, which is great because it is so highly portable. I've been slipping it in my camera bag in place of an extra lens, which makes it so easy to bring along anywhere. And, you can run it off of an external USB battery to extend the runtime if you really want to binge Netflix. All in all, I expect to be using this for years to come!",08/09/2020
Monica W.,5,One of my favorite purchases in the last few years,,"I love this this little projector. It surpasses all my expectations, and honestly it's probably one of my favorite purchases from the last few years.It's essentially like a soda-can size TV set that can project an image many times the size of our actual TV, onto any suitable surface anywhere. It's like having a portable cinema in my pocket. We have a giant window in our living room with a white roller blind, and turns out it's the perfect surface for a projector—instant movie theater! We used it to play Mario Kart the other day, and it was really cool to play split screen on such a giant surface. We've also watched Youtube videos in bed while projecting it on our bedroom ceiling, and screened movies using a wall at a friend's house. The other day we held a party and used it to do video projections on a way for ambience.I was worried about the brightness, but the Nebula is impressively bright.

AuxilioVeritas,5,A profoundly durable projector well-worth the money.,3,"OK. Right off the bat, this is NOT a daytime-use projector. 100 lumens gets you about as much in the day as a flashlight intended for the use of illuminating the sun.

I like to have fun in different environments and indoor movies/gaming are traditions I can not abide.In a darkened room this beautiful piece of simply phenomenal conception is amazing. I am so fond of it that tears come to my eyes when I think of leaving it behind. It is so small, yet the resolution is fantastic. I get amazing resolution at 200 inches (screen size) and surprising versatility for a projector. Suck it Samsung (your TVs are bulky, expensive and strain my eyes).Furthermore, the Nebula Capsule (by Anker) can connect to another device (my Bose SoundLink Revolve speaker, in my case) if you do not like the sound quality (not the same as Bose, but surely impressive with size and all othe...",06/02/2019

The size is wonderful, super compact, and even better that you don't need to be plugged in to use it. I wish this cheaper model had auto focus, but that's really my only complaint and it focuses just fine when I do it manually. Besides the capsule being great, the customer service has been INCREDIBLE. Any question I have had, they have been so helpful in answering and their follow up is some of the best I have seen. I updated my software and needed to wait 10 days to get access to something, and on the 10th day they followed up with me first thing in the morning. Their responsiveness, helpfulness, and kindness has been super impressive. Great product and great company, highly recommend.",27/10/2020
Ronald G.,5,I love this stupid projector. Great bang for the buck if you're aware of its limitations.,,"Lovely projector for the money. Super light weight, super portable. The built-in speaker's fine for dialog and light music (I can't imagine anyone using it as a bluetooth speaker, but hey, you can if you want to). The internal speaker seems to be very voice-focused, so speech clarity is quite nice. If you're watching action films, explosions are underwhelming for certain. Bluetooth audio to an external speaker is fantastic (I've paired it with an Aukey bar, and Aukey receiver, an Urban Kanteen speaker, and a pair of wireless buds from the dollar store, no problems with anything, and the transport controls on the speaker let you pause the picture.Unfortunately, if you're running HDMI, picture leads audio by about a half second or more due to the projector's need to re-encode the audio for BT transmission, and there's no way to adjust audio/ video sync in the necessary direction.TIP: get a bluetooth micro-keyboard for much nicer remote control of the unit. The included remote is lacking at best, and the app ...",20/02/2020
Kelsey Krenwinkel,2,Does not work well with Airplay for iPad,7,"I bought this projector because I wanted to use it in my classroom to airplay from my iPad. I thought it was perfect because it was small, wireless (no cords!!!!!), and I could easily move it around my room. Once I got it and began using it, however, I realized that airplay from the projector to my iPad is very slow, sometimes unresponsive, and now won't even connect. The other issue is that it's really not very bright unless you have a very dark room. This is an issue for my classroom because my students still need enough light to write their notes. I had such high hopes for this projector. I will say that I liked the fact that it has the remote app (super convenient). The only thing I would recommend this projector for is to watch Netflix. Besides that, not worth it. I'm really underwhelmed, especially for the price.",04/08/2018
Texi,4,Amazing concept that could use a little tweaking,null,"Our family decided to put on an outdoor movie in the backyard, so I started looking at buying a projector. I quickly realized we were going to need a lot of cords/connections to make it work. And then I ran across this handy product.Pros:- No extension cords needed, no connecting to a receiver/laptop for media content, and speakers already built in... AMAZING!! Plus, controlling it all from my own phone (or the provided remote if I want).- Has apps for streaming content, which basically makes it a portable smart TV- The speakers are great for most use, but for an outdoor movie with lots of people, we decided to connect it via bluetooth to our Sonos Move speaker. Brilliant built-in option, and again, no cords needed.- Setup was extremely easy.- Auto keystone correction feature is really handy. It senses the angle of tilt and adjusts the picture to match, so you don't end up with a weird trapezoid shape.- Has screw in feature at the bottom for a standard tripod.Cons:- Noticeably dim. This was the biggest dis...",24/03/2020
Jordan,3,Not what you think,,If you’re a teacher or a businessman then this will be just fineBut if you just want to connect to a projector via Bluetooth and play YouTube videos on your wall or ceiling...this is far from the right productIt needs WiFi because it is its own device and in that sense you can use YouTube or even NetflixBut this is the type of purchase that involves several more purchases afterwards if you want to utilize the productSince I can’t do anything with it I just use it as a speakerMaybe one day I’ll get the type of projector that works with a phone in a simple mannerAnd maybe one day I’ll get to use this as intended..but it is literally not possible right now,15/08/2020
SSG Cross,5,Truly amazing piece of hardware. I'm blown away!,2,"First the not so great: Initially it is kind of a pain to set up, but after that it's great! For some reason it was having trouble connecting to Netflix at first, but once it connected it was good to go and didn't disconnect at all while watching a movie. So perhaps it was just having issue initially. If it's a consistent issue I will post and update and perhaps rethink my rating but right now I'm having no problems with it anymore and it works fantastic. Also if you are getting this device I would advise you to go into settings and update it right away that might also fix any issues you might have with the device. Setting up Netflix and signing in with your account takes a little patience but it's worth it, and once it's done your don't have to do it again. For the price I was kind of hoping it would come with a HDMI cable but that's ok I just went and bought one real quick. So if you don't have a spare lying around I would order one with this. Once you get used to the Console Control App, it is actually ...",05/07/2018
K. Engell,5,Super cool little projector,3,"I love this little projector.  It's pretty bright and the image is even great during the day in a darkened, but not dark room.  I love how I can lay on the floor and point it at the ceiling and watch movies.  It saved the night on New Years when we were with friends and the power went out.  I was able to use an app to view live coverage of the ball dropping while using my phone as a hot spot.  Also Anker customer support has been excellent for all of my Anker products.  They reply to emails in less than 24 hours...much less more like an average of 2 hours.  With this projector they helped me add the google play store.  I would definitely recommend this little guy.",24/05/2019
802VTSteve,2,"Was probably a great purchase in 2018, but there are better options for price in 2021",null,"This projector is really cool looking. It's really easy to use and connect via HDMI or the app. It's compact size makes it easy to take with you, where ever you go, and the speaker is powerful enough that people in the room can hear everything they need to hear.BUT- the video quality is a bit dated at this point. Low ANSI Lumen number and non HD video playback makes this projector a relic of the past that has been bypassed by technology of newer items.Customer support was great to work with, and offered up a few great things to try and make this work better to fit my needs. Getting to be a beta tester and access the play store was HUGE....but it still left me wanting more from a video quality standpoint.Simply put- I don't think it's worth the price when compared to other similar projectors on the market in 2021.",09/04/2021
Chenoa Allen,5,"small and portable, great functionality",,"This is a great little projector! My priorities picking a projector were - a small, portable projector with its own operating system so I can watch hulu / netflex / etc without plugging my phone into it. The Nebula fits the bill. After I had it a while, I also wanted to watch Google Play movies on it, and the Play app isn't available on the Nebula OS - but Anker customer service was super helpful (and fast!) getting me set up with the beta version of the full Android OS so that I can download and use any apps available in the Play store.There are a few downsides - the remote doesn't work with most apps, so you need to use the phone app that turns your phone into a remote, and that app is clunky. It's not bright enough to watch in bright daylight. But if you are looking for a small projector that is portable and doesn't require extra wires (besides the charging cable), I think it's great. I've always been very happy with Anker products, and this one is no exception.",01/11/2019
Amazon Customer,2,Just ok not great,2,I wanted to like this mini projector so much but i just can't. So first of all you can't mirror movies from your tablet even if you paid for the movie. It's great that the hulu and Netflix apps let you pre download them if you decide to use this camping but i wanted to use my tablet considering i have over 200 movies and 7 tv shows on it. Also the projector doesn't come with the google play store even though it's powered by Android. They also have a bug when connecting your phone to it because it disconnects every 20 seconds or so. I decided to give the hdmi cable option a try but the sound is about a second behind so it's a little annoying. They really need to update the software if they are going to charge as much as they do,06/11/2020
ebp913,5,Awesome portable projector!,2,"We have several friends with large projector displays... huge boxes with lots of wires, a giant screen, etc.  We initially wanted something like that but when we came across this item, it was exactly what we were looking for. We travel a lot and we wanted to be able to bring something small and portable with us without lugging an entire bag of gear.  This projector is exactly that! The battery life is great and the picture quality is awesome for such a small device. I haven't once though to myself, man this picture quality is bad.  It's a bit of trade off but if portability is your biggest concern, this is the device for you.  We use it for watching movies, sports, etc outside and it's perfect for that.  The size is just amazing for what it can do. We've downloaded some movies directly to the device so we can use it when we don't have wifi or cell reception and it's perfect for that also.  Love this thing!  We also got this tripod for it and it's perfect... small and compact and flexible https://www.amazon...",12/09/2018
CL,5,Awesome projector! Totally replaced my TV.,2,Awesome projector. Much better/brighter picture and louder sound than I expected. The room doesn’t have to be completely dark and you still get a great picture even just on white wall without a screen. It’s pretty easy to set up. Customer service is responsive if you need them. You can download Netflix and Hulu movies and watch movies offline (for example outside) so you don’t have to be on WiFi. The Aptiode app that you have to use to access Netflix/Hulu is clunky but usable. I tried using airplay to mirror Zoom dance classes but there is a slight delay. Still have not gotten it to mirror my laptop using the hdmi but haven’t gone through trouble shooting with Cust service yet.,02/11/2020
Goth Spice,1,Not worth the money,2,"1. They’ve lowered the price on this item the day I received it in the mail. Since Amazon won’t do a price adjustment, I would have to return this item and purchase a new one at the lowered price. This is insane considering that prime isn’t prime anymore, I’d have to wait another 3 weeks for this to process.2. The apps available are weak and a waste of space so you have to stream or mirror your other device.3. Since you can’t adjust the zoom or angle of this projector. You have to invest more money in a tripod.So unhappy with this.",29/04/2020
Just another public opinion,1,Look elsewhere not very bright and blurry edges,,"The picture is horrible at 100 inches. You either get clean edges and horrible center picture or horrible edges and decent center pictures. For 300 you can find better options out there. It’s not even 720p it’s like vga video quality. The speaker is horrible. It says you can use it as a Bluetooth speaker. My iPhone’s speaker is better than this thing. Will also just randomly shut off on you. For this price, i would expect better. This is going back. Will try something else.",11/06/2021
jairo steve carrero,4,It's so small and it does so much!,null,"It's loud, the fans, if you are in a small room and have it replacing your tv. It sparks conversation among friends as it it super small and can expand so much and still look super clear. It could be brighter but hey it already does a LOT for its size. Sometimes on videos that are too saturated it will lag, like the ones from Kurzgesagt.... for some reason his videos always freeze and I'm not kidding. I never got it to connect to the air play or smart view, I had to get me an external hdmi smart view adaptor to make it work as such. You won't be able to turn a party with the speaker as it lacks base and loudness; however it works good on a small room to watch a movie. Overall if you want to get one for on the go and to surprise family and friends at parties this is your gadget. If you want something professional or robust they offer more options.",07/01/2021
JE,5,Anker Service is the Best - the Nebula is pretty great too.,2,"When we bought the Nebula, I pulled the plastic tab the remote to activate the battery.  I didn't realize this wasn't like a the tabs that come on toys and ended up breaking the battery cover.  I called Anker and, Kevin, immediately sent out a replacement remote - no questions asked.  Great, well and good and expected.A month later, Kevin called back to see how the remote and projector were working - it Anker, they were working great - and then told me about the carrying case.  I had considered buying this case at the time of purchases, but didn't want to put money into it.  Assuming, like other customer service companies, that this was an attempt to up-sale, I asked Kevin the price.  ""No, no,"" he said, ""It doesn't cost anything.  It is for customer appreciation.""  Talk about going above and beyond.  They fixed the issue, called to make sure the issue was fixed, and value added just to make sure we were satisfied.As to the Nebula, is is pretty great too.

Pzam,5,"Small, compact and works!",,So I was hesitant to purchase this because of the price. I was worried I'd spend and it wouldn't work. But I am so glad I bought this. It is limited on the apps you can download but yes you can call customer service and they will give you the instructions and password to unlock the Google apps. Makes using it so much better. I am definitely happy with this purchase. It does need to be somewhat dark to be visible but once it's dark it is awesome. I know there's a brighter one but I didn't want to spend quite yet. But I definitely recommend this. We use it outside to watch the basketball games and you can make it pretty big,10/08/2020
Seth,5,Best purchase!,2,"Before I make any critiques, I absolutely LOVE this projector. I bought it initially because I was stuck in the Army barracks and not able to do much because of COVID and needed some entertainment. For its price and size, it is absolutely unmatched. The quality of video is absolutely amazing and when focused is just as good as any TV. The brightness of course could be better but again, with the price and size of the projector I was beyond impressed. I also love how you can download just about any app to exist to watch whatever movies you want on the go. I’m not a huge fan of the remote, it seems like it’s functionality is very limited with a lot of the apps and sometimes bad on connection— easily fixed with the Nebula app. You can use the mouse mode to control everything. Brilliant product and I highly recommend it",15/10/2020
emcube,5,"Impressive Portability, quality and value",null,"With total regret, I ended up returning this product due to the image being *very* minutely off balance, but when making the image larger, it was all could notice on the exact fit wall used. It makes an amazing 9’ x 6’ image (12 feet away) which was great for wall casted Blue Planet (4 foot dolphins!). Best in the dark, but can also be used in low light for personal use, or a budget business use. If in a daylight setting - it does better about 3-5 feet from the projection surface. The speaker works well, but I paired it with a Bluetooth speaker (highly recommended) for full depth of sound to match the giant picture. This portable projector is: easy to set up out of the box, the phone app Is well integrated, the available downloads (hulu, Netflix, etc) appear just like on other viewing devices, phone mirroring is easy, the fan is a low quiet hum (less then a desk fan), and the battery lasts the 4+ hours it promises.

From all my amazon experiences this company has one of the best customer service to address the problem you are facing at hand; hence I added one more star.For whopping 300 dollars not convinced whether this was all worth it. First the best feature: SPEAKERS. Honestly I don’t feel the need to attach any external speakers. Second best: Battery life. It’s pretty awesome you can watch a whole movie or two without having to worry about recharging. Everything else is nothing impressive; the light is pretty low, can’t see much as long as the sun is still hangs low in the sky, resolution is low that you can see the individual pixels at just about 30+ inches screen size(I cannot imagine the low quality it being projected for 50in).

NeitLife Adventures,4,Excellent little piece of hardware with serious software flaws,null,"We’ve been talking ourselves out of returning this in favor of a cheaper option but the convenience is just so worth it. It’s tiny, it comes with decent sound (think mid-range Bluetooth speaker), and it can run without cables.The downsides are there. I gave up on the onboard apps. The remote doesn’t work with any streaming service and requires you to use the Nebula app. And even then, you have to change it to “mouse mode” in order to make it work. Highly recommend connecting it to an Apple TV or hooking up a fire stick to keep the bulk down.That being said, I connected the Xbox and ran with that.Automatic keystone adjustment is hit or miss. In ideal settings I’m sure it works well. But on an RV it’s basically point it and the brightest surface in the room you’re in so it’s hard to get the keystone levels dialed in. Eventually you accept it the way it is. So, the portability makes it worth it. The tiny fan sounds like static so it can be a little annoying if it’s close to you.",24/10/2020

You have to physically move the device. I really feel like I was sold something pretty. The wife uses it and likes it, but she has the same complaints as me. Too lazy to return this and it is functional at the very least. Maybe their more expensive models solve some of these problems? Try them first.",02/09/2020
Stepchild75,5,Netflix - Android phone workaround,,"Although I didn't really notice the small print in the advertising that Netflix can't be mirrored from an Android phone, due to copyright content.

We had to tither the Smart phone connection, or share it as a Hot Spot, then the projector picked it up.  Phone Hot Spot is fast enough nowadays to work with the streaming Netflix on the projector successfully without lag.The other workarounds, on the internet stated to start playing Netflix on your Android phone, then screen share/cast it, then it would pop up on the projector - no go.

I've been eyeing portable projectors on and off for a few years now because I don't own a TV and don't want to bc I find them clunky and easily outdated. So I tend to watch videos on my laptop instead. That's gotten hard on the eyes over the years and not so great for when I have guests over. I've only had this little powerhouse for less than a week but I'm already in love! I'm pretty indecisive, esp with large purchases, so I looked at a lot of options before opting for the Nebula b/c it's kind of expensive relative to some of the other pocket projectors out there.

Pam,3,Disappointed and underwhelmed,null,"I wanted to like it and keep it, I really did. I kept trying to convince myself that the picture quality wasn’t bad (it’s merely okay), that I wasn’t bothered by how poor the speaker is (it’s so bad), and I’m sad this was not the TV replacement I was hoping for.My apartment is pretty dark for most of the day compared to most places I’ve lived and it still wasn’t dark enough until night for the projector to show nicely. The speaker is honestly really terrible when compared with…anything else. I connected my UE Boom via Bluetooth in an attempt to solve that issue but the projector wasn’t smart enough to correct for the lag. The difference in audio quality between my external speaker and the projector was the final straw—the audio should not be a selling point.The app that you use to navigate the projector with is a little glitchy but I figured it out and navigation became a breeze, which I appreciated.

Anker agreed to honor the “deal of the day” price of my initial purchase and work with me to get me a replacement before upcoming travel. I received the new nebula today and this time setup went as expected. While it is still early to say, so far I am happy with how the device is working.———I am puzzled about all the good reviews.

But if you are looking for small, portable, good quality for an affordable price, then this should fit your needs. I’m in the military and deploy/TDY a lot. I couldn’t ask for a better versatile product. Not to mention when I’m home, the kids love using it. The sound quality is great, the resolution is better than I expected for such a small product.Update 6/17/2020: for some unknown reason the sound is now distorted when playing a video no matter what platform I use.

How convenient! So easy to store and put away and bring along. We use it for outdoor movie night in our backyard and in my kids’ room for a tv night before bed. We just project the shows/movie on their wall while they watch it on their bed. The picture quality is great. The reason for only 4 stars is it’s not loud enough for outdoor movie night. I have a big backyard and I project the movie to our fence. So it’s not loud enough when outside in a big space. But it is loud enough indoors.

It works fine, but for the price point, it’s no where near the sound quality of my portable JBL. So, we run the sound through the JBL. I think I’m being picky though, and I would still buy it again, even using just the built in speaker.We use this on the patio, on the garage door, on the dock, and even on the kids ceiling.

Easy to set up and start streaming quickly. Built in speaker is good enough for most occasions, but easily connects to a larger Bluetooth speaker if needed. Picture quality and brightness aren’t going to be comparable to full size projectors, but still looks good in a dark space. The internal operating system is constantly improving where you have access to all your streaming services. Of course Anker has excellent customer service and they are quick to help you troubleshoot any issues you have. I would highly recommend this projector for an outdoor movie, traveling or just as a way to watch a big screen occasionally on your wall at home.

I was not able to do Windows without using the HDMI connection.

Good Times,5,Very cool and excellent customer service!,,"* Initial review*First off - this is a fantastic idea and rock solid device! Works great and is mobile as can be, which we love!Initially, after spending time with support, I was eventually told Hulu does not work on this device. If you are planning to download the Hulu app from the App Store, note that it will not work. Or at least it did not initially for me, even though I followed the instructions and even called tech support.They do mention in their description that mirroring or casting Hulu will not work but they mention the app will. It definitely did not work initially, even after spending quite a bit of time with tech support.*EDIT*Helen from the customer service team from Anker has been incredibly responsive and helpful and happy to say the projector is now working great with Hulu!

We did a big family test running the native Amazon Prime app — Black Panther looked and sounded better than we could have imagined. We projected onto a large, smooth white wall, with the image at about 4'x6'. Stunning! My husband also screencast to it from his Windows Surfacebook and had zero trouble establishing a connection. He is excited to use it with customer presentations. It's not often that a product is as out-of-the-box awesome as the Nebula Capsule.

William Coleman,5,Good product with even better customer service!,,"Used for business presentation and I failed to adjust the brightness all the way up so it was hard to see - gotta play with the settings.  I downloaded a Netflix show on my phone and tried to stream it offline to the projector and some copyright notice came up saying I could not stream this kind of content and that I needed a plug. Huh? I just want to stream a show from my phone to the projector but the good lawyers at Netflix have made this not possible. Instead, if you want to watch movies or shows in an area without an internet connection, you need to download the movies via the Nebula. This is the same situation for ANY brand that you buy. This was a trick that Kevin from Nebula told me. My original review pointed out some shortcomings of the unit but they called me to specifically address these concerns so now I have a number of fixes to try. Great customer service! I know that if I have an issue with the unit, they will definitely be there to support me.",19/09/2018
Launie J.,3,Youtube sign in tip/trick,null,I was absolutely shocked at the top tier quality of this product. The fact that I can use this in a well lit room is mind blowing!One major issue though. The apps. Specifically YouTube. Upon initial attempts the app continues to crash and unfortunately this has been mentioned in prior reviews multiple times and it doesn’t appear as though Anker isn’t too vested in resolving this. Nonetheless I found a slight lifehack for this Nebula!“Watch on tv”If you’re signed into YouTube on your phone and you have a playlist you’d like to access or if you PAY for no commercials .. this is the simplest method of having YouTube recognize your account while projected.1. Go to settings (within YouTube) on the Nebula (you MAY have to select “more settings”)2. Scroll down to “Link with TV code”  2a. Once the code generates go to step 33. Open YouTube up in your mobile app and go to settings4. Select “watch on tv” it should then ask you to enter the code you will see projected via Nebula.Keep in mind this will only have speci...,25/03/2021
Jewel,5,This thing is AWESOME!!!,null,"I got this for my family for getting together with people outdoors/socially distanced during the pandemic.  I also bought a portable screen, and I'm going to set it up in the street so that we can watch movies with the neighbors or with my parents without getting too close.  It does not need to be plugged into anything- it runs off battery and is controlled by an app on my phone.  We can stream Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, etc.  It was a splurge, but no regrets.  We are having a blast.  And it's truly the size of a soda can.  We will connect it by bluetooth to some more powerful speakers, but the speaker on this does the trick if it's just my family.  Super fun, cool thing.  It's worth the extra money to not have to deal with power cords.  I'm going to let my teenager invite his friends over to watch Hamilton.",08/07/2020
Mia M,5,Love this thing!,,I love this projector. I have a small room and didn't want a wall to be taken up by an actual TV nor did I want to make any holes/marks. The sound is incredible out of this tiny thing. We have had parties and played it outdoors and everyone loves it. The remote is ehh but you can use your phone as a remote as well.Almost a year later and my device would not turn on. I contacted customer service and it was quick reply and they rectified the issue very fast. They even followed up after sending me the replacement to make sure that everything went well.  Very simple and swift.I cannot recommend this more. Best gift I have ever gotten myself.,05/11/2019
Buckeye in da Boro,5,An entire movie night... in a soda can!  It's amazing!,null,"I bought two of these in 2018 as gifts for my daughters in college.  They use them for movie nights as you can watch Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, etc. anywhere you have wi-fi and all from this tiny projector... literally no cords attached.  I always regretted not buying one for myself, especially as we have been social distance gathering in the back yard, so they bought me one for Father's Day.  The one I got had some issue where it wouldn't hold a charge, and they bought it a couple months early so Amazon wouldn't take it back, but Anker offers a one year warranty.  Literally one online form to fill out and one email, and I mailed it back (free) and got a (free) replacement in less than a week.  Great customer service from Anker!

M. Beth Van Ven,5,What a cool smart little projector,null,"Wow!  In our VW EVC set the capsule on the top bunk and add a white cloth and it was Magic!  Runs pretty well with WiFi, a bit frustrating to set up but once we got it going it ran about 2 1/2 hours but it was fantastic that you can connect a battery while it keeps running. The HDML port to my Kindle was amazing!  Knew we would be without WiFi so I downloaded a few movies (Bloodshot) and was just awesome!!  Haven’t tried the DVD player yet but it’s on the list!  Sound is great, size is a pop can and a neoprene cozy keeps it safe as there was no bag or case as I’d seen in some unboxing reviews. It’s very nice to have a manual focus and the remote control works pretty well.",23/08/2020
Julia,5,I. AM. BLOWN. AWAY,2,"This little thing is amazing!!!! Yes, its expensive, but worth investing in if you need a projector. You can go totally wireless once its charged, and IT IS A SMART TV!! like when you turn it on it is already a smart tv without having to download any programs... so you just sign into your netflix or hulu or whatever and voila! Its pretty awesome.Its not amazing for using when the sun is out– preferably in darker or shaded areas. The speakers are AWESOME and loud. It really does last 4 hours when fully charged. On the flip side– it takes like 10 hours to reach a full charge lol but it works while plugged in so its not a major issue. 10/10 get this little prjector!!",28/09/2018

Meher,5,Died in two years (Updated),,"Update: Anker's support team followed up with me and went above and beyond to resolve my issue.===============The bulb stopped turning on. I was told that this had 30000 hours of life and I had come even barely close to that amount. Because I am out of the warranty period, Anker is refusing to support me in any way - they don't even want to give me instructions on how to fix it myself or give me the correct part numbers. I tried contacting some repair stores nearby to see if they'd fix it and they all said that they cannot fix it. I tried searching online for instructions on disassembly but I got nothing. So I basically have a can that should have been worth a couple hundred bucks but is now sitting useless because Anker refuses to provide even a minimal amount of support.I'd recently purchased a Nebula Mars as an upgrade (prior to this projector breaking down), but given this level of lack of support from Anker, I'm considering returning my Mars.

JCTEXAS,5,Must have for those looking for experiences vs. resolution,,"I did a lot of research on this tiny magic can-sized contraption and waited for a discount code that brought down the price to $260 on Amazon.  Knowing its limitations in terms of brightness and that it has a resolution of 480p are paramount in limiting expectations.  But this magic contraption  made up for it.  Just think about the portability aspect of this.  I can sit on my back deck without cords and without having to plug in a roku/fire stick or additional speakers.  I had an adequate budget projector, but its lack of portability and standalone use made it impractical for impromptu use or to take on camping trips.  I streamed a Quiet Place on Friday the 13th as my christening of the device and it was amazing.  Even before the sun set the picture was crisp and after it was dark the quality of this product shined.  Projected onto a 100% portable projector screen it made for a night of fun for all that came out.

SR5K,4,"Easy to set up, plug and play.",null,"This is a great, little and extremely portable projector to use.  It was plug and play using my eye phone.  I didn’t have to fiddle with any settings.  I used an HDMI cable into the projector as recommended in the instruction sheet to an HDMI to iPhone connector.  Very easy.  The picture quality was very good.  The only thing to be aware of is to achieve the best picture quality you really need it to be dark.  I used the projector outside at night and had great results.  I tried again at sunset and had to wait until the sun went down and it got dark.  It doesn’t come with a remote but you can focus using the built in focus dial.  For the price, the size and its capability it an amazing little projector.  The internal speaker is very good, but keep in mind it’s not going to produce Dolby digital sound.  Given the limitation of needing to be dark it’s a great value, very to easy set up, plug and play and allowed me to entertain a group of campers with movies from my iPhone in the evening.",16/08/2019
Amazon Customer,5,SO SO GOOD.,6,"Listen: I usually skip this whole review process out of sheer laziness but, this projector has brought me out of my shell! Please pay attention to these words very carefully.... THIS IS THE BEST PROJECTOR I HAVE EVER OWNED. I’ve owned maybe 17 in my lifetime and this one is by far the best. It’s so small yet more powerful than my larger ones. Very descreet, yet the 360 speaker volume is tremendous and it fills up the entire room with what appears to be surround sound. It’s so easy to use and is truly a portable soda can smart tv. So freaking good! Order now. Any bad reviews I’d treat with great incredulousness. This is the real deal.",09/04/2018
Daniel Chavez,5,"Product Quality, Company Response/Customer Service are Unrivaled",null,"PRODUCT QUALITY:I absolutely LOVE this little Nebula Capsule and am VERY impressed with Anker as a whole.  The projector is straightforward, easy to use and is about the size of a soda can.  I struggled a little with the initial setup because mine arrived with one of the (many) Asian languages pre-loaded and I had to guess where to go to find English in the settings. Turns out it wasn't that hard by following the settings icon, and it probably would have been much easier if I had just emailed customer support.The image is super clear, and the sound is great for the size speaker that it comes with.  Don't expect it to be loud enough for a giant backyard projector with lots of ambient noise, but there is Bluetooth sound capability for the times when you want it to be really loud.

Nathaniel,5,Super handy and functional on the go projector an smart tv.,,"I purchased this and the Capsule II.  Hands down I like this version in almost every aspect.  First, don't expect this to be used during the day in a bright room. Otherwise, it is crisp and clean image.  The manual focus dial works fine, but isn't as good as the auto focus on the Capsule II (I think it works just fine though).  The speaker is loud and suitable for watching a movie.The best part about this is you can stream netflix or amazon directly from the device if on wifi, or from your phone/tablet through screen sharing/chromecast.  It is VERY portable.  I keep mine in an Anker case but often just slide it in the side of my backpack if I have a quick meeting and connect it to the Anker tripod.The battery life was over 4 hours or so, but you can also charge it while watching if needed.It would work fine as a projector in a bedroom with the blinds pulled down for a kid or otherwise.

kevin,3,"Video isn't that sharp, 420p, but rest is good",null,"Things I dislike about it1. The video isn't that sharp - this is probably the main reason why I wouldn't recommend it to someone2. The remote control buttons don't always work. Sometimes I have to press a button multiple times for it to register even though I'm pointing right at the projector.Things I like:1. It's really small and portable2. You can install Netflix, Amazon Video and Youtube.3. You can mirror your smartphone or computer4. 4 hour battery life is pretty good5. I can connect to my bluetooth headphones, so I can watch it at night without disturbing my roommate.People said the noise from the projector is too loud. I don't find that an issue since the noise will be covered by the sound from your movie. I don't even notice the sound when I'm playing a show.In summary, if you're not too picky about the image quality, this projector is pretty good. It's a bit expensive, but very portable.",12/01/2019
Laiv,2,"Compared to others at the same price point, disappointed.",,"I had high hopes for this as it is such a cool concept. But the brightness and the clarity is not worth the price. I've tried other no-name brand projectors that were less expensive and unfortunately they were brighter and clearer. This was a gift to my son, so he enjoys it and cannot tell the difference. But having tried others, I say the price is not worth it. And it is missing an audio jack for external speakers. The Phillips picopix nano projector is a cheaper much better option and the sharpness and brightness is comparable.",13/01/2021

A group of 4-5 people need to be really quite and strain themselves to hear the movie or whatever is being projected. Keep in mind, that if you are outdoors, it may be impossible.Setting it up is relatively easy. But there doesn't seem to be way to beam from your phone. So, I suspect the apps on the unit will turn pretty stale in a couple of years - like they do on the (not so) smart TVs. And then, this unit will be obsolete.Otherwise, we have been using it in our backyard, so it does its job, I guess",16/08/2020

We don’t watch TV anymore (we’ve never watched cable TV, only Netflix, YouTube, Amazon prime). The screen is adjustable to any size - you can have it from tiny to wall size. The sound is good but we connect it to our speaker for a better quality.The only downsides are - battery life is short!! Super short! It lasted maybe an hour or two!

Remote controls are always clunky for digital navigation.Overall: I like this product a lot. I find certain light, despite being the same 'brightness', makes it more difficult to see. Particularly if the scenes are already dark, it can get washed out. The darker the room, the better. Also, despite having the projector on a flat surface, there seems to be a slight tilt to the picture. Not sure if that's a device issue or not but I noted it on a couple different surfaces.

The speaker is good, but not great. Loud enough to hear across the yard but we connect it to another Bluetooth speaker for better movie sound. You can use some apps directly on the  projector or stream from a mirracast device to it. I'm not sure if it works with Apple products though.

That is unless you live out in the boonies. I live about an hour away from any major metropolitan area/airport and it isn’t dark enough but maybe it is pitch black outside where you live it may work.

In addition to the enclosed remote control, you also have to download an app to your smartphone to access some of the features and turn your phone's screen into a mouse pad.

The speaker is more than loud enough for a living room although I would go with the Epson if you were looking for a home theater.  This is perfect for entertaining guests outside or doing a powerpoint presentation.  Heck, this would go perfectly in a bedroom if you are not looking to run cables, make holes, and go through a hassle.

The sound was loud enough that we had to ask her to turn it down so it wouldn't wake up her brother.so let me recapPro's-works-good sound-good picture-tiny and convenientcon's-I'll let you know when i find one;)",25/07/2019
Lisa D.,5,Fantastic if you're not picky about the little nuances,,"I bought this primarily to watch in my dorm room at college because the space is too small for a TV, and it works great. Out of the box, it looks very high quality and is something I'm proud to show off. Of course, it's not a crazy HD projector, but it does the job, especially in the dark. The image can get pretty crisp when you adjust the focus knob and I don't see any blurriness at the edges like some other PICO projectors have. Compared to my full-size Epson projector back at home, the picture is not as sharp (of course), but it will do for standard, everyday viewing.Now to the cons, there was no HDMI cable included. It's not really a big deal since I have my own, but other projectors I've looked at included an HDMI cord. I feel like at this price point, there should be a cable thrown in there to justify the price. The fan noise is a definitely noticeable, but it's not to the point where I can't hear the sound or get annoyed by it. The remote only works when you point it a certain way, which can be a bi...",16/12/2019
WM5R,5,Works well for my intended use.,null,"I got this mainly to use for teaching small groups of volunteers how to use certain applications.  It works great.  I love that I can carry it in my purse along with my tablet and pull it out for impromptu training sessions.  The picture is plenty clear for my purposes.  It also works great for general movie viewing at home and playing my music via bluetooth while working around the house.  You do generally have to dim the lights to see the picture really well.  This is not an issue for me.Please note that This is NOT a professional projector that I would use for presentations in a meeting room or class setting.  If you are looking for a powerful projector that you can use in large groups with the lights on, invest in a professional one designed for that purpose.",10/01/2019
R. Caldwell,5,Great!,,This thing is really impressive so far. A lot of value packed into this tiny device. It is much smaller than I expected but works great. The app on my phone works great to control it. The built in Netflix and Prime Video apps are super. Works great with hdmi cable for laptop.  Battery powered and built in WiFi.  All make this thing really powerful and easy to use. The only caveat is that it requires low light conditions for the projected image but I think that is expected for any projector.,03/11/2019
Kimberly,5,Quality! Quality! Quality!,,Oh my awesomeness! My husband loves it. We purchased the model below this for our daughter at college instead of a TV (she didn't want a TV) and the only thing that bums him out about it not having the ability (the way you do with the model below it) to recharge it or use a portable battery with it - you do have to plug it in. But - it has four freaking hours of battery life either way! The picture is gorgeous and clear and believe me he did the research on the lower model so I was not hesitant to get him this model as a Christmas present - score one for mom!,13/01/2020

Kevin,1,"A complete mess filled with issues, not worth price.",null,"Product has a ton of issues. Many of the apps on the store have a lot of bugs & issues that are never addressed such as: VLC, NordVPN, Netflix, YouTube etc.For some reason, out of the box the remote did not work at all...? I instead had to use my phone as a remote. Which is inconvenient since I also wanted to use the device to mirror my phone.It freezes really bad sometimes whenever you plug in a storage device into it to play something. And instantly reboots and disconnects from phone.It mirrors phones fine and at the core of this device it gets the job done... but many of the features and apps are not optimized or ever looked at.The device is convenient, at the cost of it being extremely inconvenient in many other ways.

Tomas,5,Almost not buying due to customer support,null,"I love this machine in all honesty. Replaced my TVs and opened up a world of space in my rooms. Never had to manually turn it on with the power button in 2 months of owning it. Until my remote failed. I changed the batteries, angled remote everywhere I could, and just gave up and started to power on from the device. I called tech/customer support and spoke to Kevin who laughed at me for wanting a remote control capable of turning my device on and off, ""the remote control was not designed to power on the device."" Okay, so me using it for 6 weeks with no issues was just a fluke and who's dumb idea was it to make a remote control without a functioning power button? Well I just got my replacement remote that I worked and waited way too much for, and it turns my device on (Wow! Big shock there).Great product and I have no complaints about it, just dont ever call the makers for anything.

Rey Buzon,5,This is the one! PICO projector for movies/show in full effect!,null,"Let me start by saying THIS IS THE ONE for movies and shows!*It is a pico projector at 100 lumens but for the price and performance it beats others in the same price range ($300-$450) hands down.Seriously don’t waste any more time researching.  Take the leap and you won’t regret it.The tech specs don’t do it justice. I own many full size and pico projectors so I’m not just saying it blindly. This out performs my M300A (300 lumens) at $399 (but I need that for work).The Nebula Capsule has fuller sound and way better looking.Build quality is solid and has a fast operating system.Remote is nicer as well.Again, if you compare the specs side by side the Nebula Capsule doesn’t seem like the choice. As a person who has physically compared it with others let me save you time.If you want to be happy with what you’re buying and enjoy using it for movies/shows. THIS IS THE ONE!",22/12/2018
MaryMary,5,A MUST HAVE IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PORTABLE PROJECTOR,null,"Let me start off by saying I rarely submit reviews unless a product has either really disappointed me or has won me over and this product has certainly managed to do the latter.  I was apprehensive about purchasing something this expensive but was lucky enough to have spotted this item as a ""Deal of the day"" on Amazon for about $100.00 off.  Since my family and I have been spending a lot more time outside at night, because of the nice weather, I figured why not give this a try.  I was impressed by the good reviews after purchasing it and couldn't wait for it to come in so I could try it out.  Well it's been roughly a month since I've had it and I've been using it on a nightly basis.  I can tell you it has definitely lived up to it's positive reviews.

Big picture that projects to any screen or wall, I don’t use a screen, still works fine.  The remote is light weight, non-responsive from a distance, seems cheap...but so is the projector.  This is great for people who want a projector in their life but are not looking to put the money into getting the best of the best.  Good solid machine here.

Sam F,3,"Well manufactured, disappointing audio",null,"The Capsule is an impressive product straight out of the box, in fact the packaging is very impressive.  The product is clearly well manufactured and made from quality materials.  The size and the portability make it a compelling product, and quick to set up.  The image is quality is good for a projector its size.  It is a impressively designed product.I would be willing to live with the image quality if the sound worked.  I got rid of my TV and planned to use Capsule to project from my Apple TV.  Unfortunately, there was a noticeable lag between the image and the sound, could be bearable if it were not my primary viewing device.  Then Airplay does not work for popular apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and HBO GO because of an issue with streaming copyright content.  The native apps within the Capsule work well but also have limited functionality; Amazon Prime only worked view browser.

Victoria S.,5,Absolutely pleased in every way,null,This was a Christmas gift for my father and i originally purchased a completely different mobile projector and it does not even compare to this product. The quality and durability alone is phenomenal. The sound quality is perfect especially with the 360 degree sound projection with the design of the product amplified sound in all directions. I am very pleased with how the projector automatically adjusts its display and is able to match the size of the wall it’s projecting on. I held the projector towards the ceiling and then faced my living room wall and it automatically fit the different sizes of each surface it was projecting on. Absolutely retuning the other projector and keeping this one for sure!,22/12/2019

I had a question about streaming, so I sent an email to the support email figuring it would be 3 days before I heard from someone, if I heard from someone - it was so quick, they were so helpful, there was no nonsense, just really understanding, helpful people.  We aren't really tech savvy so to have them answer so quickly made the device worth the investment to us!  I use it as a bluetooth speaker in my office and then for movies at night.  Totally worth it.",04/11/2019
Melanie,5,Tiny powerhouse,null,"My husband first showed me a video of someone reviewing this projector and I had my initial doubts at first just because it's so small that I wouldn't have imagined it having the capabilities that it does. It's definitely surprising how great this little guy can be. I think the only '""gripe""I have with it is the IR remote as you need to be pointing a certain direction for it to work correctly, but this is easily combatted with the app that you can use to control it. The picture quality is great. I think we currently have it around 80ish inches and it still looks really good. We initially just had it projecting on our wall and even that worked out well for us. With the screen we got- it just looks even better.I just love that we can pop this in our car and take it wherever we go, though we have yet to really do that. But, it is a comfort since we move around often and don't have to worry about our TV being broken anymore since we can just carry this with us. Great value!",25/01/2019

Amazon Customer,5,#Yep,null,"We were stoked to get this and upon unboxing got very discouraged it wasn’t going to do what we wanted it to do. It wasn’t until we went through 2 updates of the software that all of a sudden it clicked! We got Disney+, Netflix and Amazon connected with relative ease. We put on Moana in the backyard for the kids and neighborhood kids and they were all entranced. Our kids asked the next morning if they could “watch a movie on the wall” 😂 The brightness at night/dusk, was great but you wouldn’t be able to see it during the day. The in app remote was much easier to use than the physical one provided. Overall, we’re very happy with this purchase and can’t wait to use it while camping! We will end up getting the recommended Apple cable to connect our phones to it though so we can watch movies and shows offline",05/06/2021

LOLOkay, if you are to complain that picture quality is poor I would say don't get this. Compared to the size of this projector picture quality is acceptable to my standards and actually it's pretty good. Sound quality is not bad either. I had no problem hearing the sound and if I needed more volume I would use an external speaker but with it's 360 degree speaker it was good enough most occasions.I stream Netflix, Amazon Prime Video through it's apps or use screen mirror on my iphone.

Erica Mckimpson,5,Love this projector!,,"We use this projector instead of a TV and would not go back! It’s mobile, can connect to a Bluetooth speaker, and works perfect for streaming apps like Hulu/Netflix. The sound is perfect for any room and if you want louder can easily connects to a speaker. We've only had to use a speaker when projecting outside because even with kiddos in the house, we can hear it perfect! We’ve projected it on multiple colored (grey, cream, lavender) walls in our home and even on the side of our house, the color and brightness work well! To top it off, it’s really nice to have the remote on your phone. You can even use your phones keyboard to search and sign in for the apps. This is a great user experience feature compared to trying to type out a password on a SmartTv with a remote! My only complaint is that we don’t have more than one in our house. We honestly couldn’t imagine not having it in our home. Their customer service is great to work with, if you do face any issues. We highly recommend it to all of our friends.",16/10/2019

If that was not bad enough it does not actually give you access to the google play store. Major streaming services such as HBO Max are not available without emailing support and having to enter a unique password in order to get some of test build on the capsule.

Phone app control and screen mirroring both work well.Only two minor complaints. If you control it with the remote, remote has to point at the backside of the capsule.

I don't listen to movies loud because I have roommates but at regular sound that fan noise drives me crazy.New Update after having it for some time now.  I've lowered my rating to 1 star and I wish I could give it zero. All it's good for anymore is Netflix.  It doesnt work with my HULU or YOUTUBE, it doesnt do direct connect with mirror image.

If you just need something to show kids shows for travel, this might be a good option.Edit: Since submitting this, Anker support reached out to me and provided me access to a beta test of GSM and a public APK if YouTube TV that worked.

It's small, it's wireless, it's streams directly from itself.

lindsey,5,Easy little fella to use,null,"I was very skeptical about buying the projector, as it is smaller, and so was worried it wouldn’t work properly. But wow. I am so impressed!!! It is so easy to set up, so easy to use. So far I am in love! The only “complaint” I have, is you can’t use the remote control in the apps, so you have to use your phone. This is not inconvenient, it’s actually nice, BUT if you are out of the controller app, the projector thinks no one is watching so it will randomly go into sleep mode. It’s easy to turn back on, and I appreciate what they are trying to do by saving your projector life. Absolutely first world problems, but something to be aware of. Other wise, love this product and highly recommend it. Haven’t “gamed” on it yet, and will update review after I have tried. even though I bought it for movies not games.",12/03/2019

It’s not ideal for gaming, since it’s not HD, but I love it for everything else. It’s extremely portable. Sound wasn’t ideal but you can connect a Bluetooth speaker and you won’t experiende any audio delay if you play videos from the native device (meaning you use the built in Netflix app and don’t connect it via HDMI to something else or use screen mirroring). After emailing their extremely responsive and helpful support team, I got every video app working that I wanted (Netflix, Hulu, showtime, amazon) except for HBO NOW. I was advised by their team to buy an OTG cable which I found from Walmart, plugged a USB into it, and tried an older apk version I found online and it worked. I don’t have HBO GO but hbo go is included in the nebula App Store. Hopefully they’ll add HBO NOW soon as well, but for now the solution I found seems to work.",04/01/2019

I bought a screen, but it really isn’t necessary if you have good white wall space.We also bought the tripod, but it is too small, and I’ll rather use our old tripod which stands on the floor. We also bought the case, which again isn’t necessary. I’ll highly Reccomended you buy one by one and de decide if you want the screen, case and tripod.The Nebula itself is FABULOUS..!!!  Hard to watch movies during the day time though. But at night, it is AMAZING..!!",04/06/2018
Joe,4,Item worked fine out of the box,null,"Item has some pros and cons, first for the pros, I like the size and compact size that you can bring anywhere with ease. The item has a good battery life, watch 4 episodes of the flash before the battery drop to 15% which is still very good. The brightness is ok, not the best but if you are watching with a lamp or you have any light source turned on, the picture gets washout. For the con, so far if your watching a dark scene movie or show, it's very hard to see the characters/actors .",19/12/2019
Justin Klammer,5,A great Android projector!,,"So far I’m loving the Nebula Capsule! The built in app store is lacking but if you contact their support they’ll help you unlock the full Google App Store. Now my Capsule is essentially an Amazon Fire Stick except I don’t need a tv. I can project Netflix, Hulu, YouTube and all the other streaming apps we love.The brightness is decent but you’ll obviously need to be in a darkish room or using outside at night. I prefer keeping it charging while in use so I did have to buy a longer usb cable so it didn’t have to be right next to an outlet. This won’t be a tv replacement necessarily but it does allow for viewing experiences anywhere anytime (with proper lighting). It’s pretty nice laying in bed watching Netflix on the ceiling. I totally recommend this projector.",06/06/2019
Spitale,4,Awesome Projector when it worked properly,null,"Update - Feb 18 2019Bumping up the rating to 4/4.5 based on the very helpful and proactive Customer Support team they have. I was very happy to hear from them based on my earlier feedback. They offered to provide a replacement, which was not feasible as I have moved out of US. But was pleasantly surprised by the level of customer service and support by Anker.Will definitely recommend Anker products for quality and customer support.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The projector is pretty awesome, works well for a portable device and has been an excellent addition to home and part entertainment. Picture and sound quality is pretty good for a Pico Projector. Very easy to set up. Have enjoyed plenty of games and movies on it till very recently when I started facing battery issues.I would have given it 4+ stars except that the device would not charge at all. The in-built battery does charge and needs to be connected to a powe...",27/01/2019
Brian,5,I am Updating the review,null,"This is an update to the initial review, this product is not only cool it is totally functional and I love that it is so portable.  When I received it the remote only worked for a short time, however Anker customer service contacted me and replaced the remote.  I will say I love this product but I love the Anker company even more.  They stand by their products and go the extra mile to make sure their products are quality and meet the needs of the customer.  I will only buy Anker products in the future if they make what I am looking for!!!  I am overly impressed to say the least!!!!!!!",01/02/2019
Charles,5,"Take note, adding a USB-C to HDMI for mobile devices, lighting cord iPhone will???",,"Some devices are forbidden to project copyrighted images to a device like the Capsule, but a USB- C, or lighting adapter for HDMI, works well. I bought it for camping trips, take note to buy a power bank with this device. I bought a Blackweb power brick to watch movies, and tv off my mobile phone all night camping. Great when your watching the morning news in a tent, eating breakfast, checking on the stock market, and the other campers just ehhh, CAN'T, heh.",12/03/2019
Amazon Customer,2,It’s is a toy,null,Think of this more a novelty toy. I bought this for my basement and even in the pitch black the image is pretty dim and grainy(and very low resolution!) and the speaker is pretty bad. Thankfully you can Bluetooth to another speaker quite easily. But it is fun for taking out and using in places you might not be able to have a screen- ie we did karaoke in out backyard. The pictures are pretty deceptive on how well it actually preforms,13/06/2021
Michael,1,Stops working after about a year,,"Worked fine for about a year, but started getting power issues until it just kept turning off and didn't turn on at all. Contacted company and cause it was over a year old they won't help in replacing or  getting a discount to get a new one...save your money. Not worth it.",29/05/2020
Lexy C,5,amazing!!!,3,"incredibly easy to set up and to use.  I brought the projector outside so that I could have a socially-distanced movie night with family! I rarely write reviews, but I just had to communicate how much of a steal this projector is.",05/05/2020
Lauren s,5,I really am having alot of fun with this,null,"I really am having alot of fun with this. Now I am not a tech savvy as some other reviewers, I wouldn't be able to tell you what the lumens were, but writing from that perspective the setup was super easy, ive got my netflix and prime accounts loaded into it with no problem, and the phone app works great. I have never heard the fan over the speaker, so that does not seem to be an issue.The speaker itself is clear and impressive for the size.  I just project on the side of house, and go. I did get a deal of the day price on it, So im not sure I would have tried it at full price, but im glad i did. I think this is going to be very busy this summer.",29/05/2018
Jacey,2,Very dim,null,"Some pros:- built in wifi and smart functions- variety of options- auto keystone (only vertical thou.)The big con:The brightness is a lot dimmer than I expected. I keep my room fairly dark. Only light sources in my room are: a desk lamp and reflected LED light from bookcase. And I could not see the image clearly. It was heavily faded even in the stated condition above.Unless you're willing to use this only in a complete dark room, this is not it. Keep looking.",18/07/2019
JVelvet,3,"Not very bright, but good in dark room",null,"I was a little disappointed in this projector, but I will keep it.Cons:1) Picture isn't very bright. It's really only viewable in a dark room.2) No ability to change picture size. It's completely dependent on the distance between the projector and the screen.3) Haven't been able to get Hulu app to work on projector.Pros1) Nice little form factor2) Decent (but not awesome) sound.3) Very cool to have apps directly on the projector (like netflix)4) Can run plugged in or on batteries.",25/02/2019
Mary,5,"Watch Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime, but not able to access Apple Movies",,"I love this projector, I’ve had it for a year and a half and everyone I show it to thinks it’s the coolest invention. I take it camping and watch our downloaded Netflix movies and watch it instead of a tv from my bed, living room, outside, really where ever I want! The only downside is you can’t access any Apple movies you’ve purchased any, but you can watch Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, and amazon prime.",14/04/2020
KG,2,Not good enough,,"- Remote control doesn’t work.- The software is uber clunky.- Arrived already opened, battery and lense protectors had been removed.- The focus adjustment wheel has 5% helpful area of movement, and the other 95% range of motion is useless. You essentially cannot fine tune the focus of the image.",16/01/2021
Miller J.,5,Worth It! Great for outdoor parties and family nights in.,null,"I originally purchased a less expensive product for a backyard movie party that was clunky, inconsistent with sound and had connection issues.  I returned and went ahead and bought this after having read lots of reviews.  It is GREAT! Super easy to set-up, great sound and picture quality is good.  (It is a projector so not like watching on an HD TV but really fantastic for our outdoor movie parties). In fact, it is so easy to use, we have pulled it out for last minute movie nights projected onto the garage door.Sound is great through the device or you can easily connect to a bluetooth speaker like Echo if you need it to be louder. We rent or buy through Amazon Prime app downloaded on the device and watch movies with easy connection, connect to Netflix or YouTube or attach Apple TV with HDMI cable.  I highly recommend purchasing the adjustable tripod stand with it.  It make a huge difference in being able to move it around in different settings very easily.",03/11/2019
Billoreiley,4,Packs quite a punch for such a tiny device,null,"Great, portable projector, built-in wireless connection to stream Netflix, amazon, etc. Excellent picture quality, indistinguishable from my much larger standard digital projector, which is amazing for a device the size of a soda can. Sound quality is good but not great, but can be augmented by a Bluetooth-enabled sound system (I have not yet tried this). Screen mirroring enables viewing content from other devices, but please note that streaming services like Netflix or Amazon Prime will not work with screen mirroring, even when using an HDMI cable. downloaded movies or CD’s, however, can be viewed either by screen mirroring or directly using the HDMI connector. Overall, a great buy!",30/12/2018
Brandon P.,4,Awesome little toy!,null,"Great little gadget to have. I was really surprised how well this little unit does. The portability is fantastic, picture is really decent, sound is great for what it is. My only suggestion for manufacturers is this.  You take so much pride in the speaker and sound of this little unit as you should, however you have hobbled the capabilities by not having the capability of an audio out option for your customers. It's great that it has it's own sound and that is a selling point, but what if I want to run it through a sound bar or more capable sound machine when I'm not out and about. You are so proud of the sound that this puts out that you felt that you had to force it on consumers instead of giving more options and functionality. For that, it only gets 4 stars, otherwise I feel it is a gem for the money.",22/07/2018
Amazon Customer,5,Awesome,,So far Eve is working great.  My brother and his wife were visiting us.  So we watched Coming to America 2. And they love the picture quality so much.  They are planning to purchase Anker Nebula Capsule too. 🤗,16/04/2021
Amazon Customer,5,"Powerful, yet in a small package",2,"Totally exceeded my expectation! Brightness is awesome, you can see projection clearly even in a lit room. Connects to both my iPad and android tablets super quickly. Image correction makes sure that I don't need to tweak too much for rectangle projection. You will have some fan noise, but with speaker playing sounds it's barely noticeable. Chargeable with a power bank. Also, the support staff was super responsive, friendly and knowledgable! This is one very powerful projector jammed into a can-sized form factor. Only downside so far is that the remote only works when pointed towards the back 180 degrees of the unit. Overall strongly recommended!",10/05/2019
R. Basinger,5,"Expensive, but great projector",null,"After spending about half of the cost of this projector on another projector that had horrible picture and sound and I couldn't get a refund from the seller, I researched and found this portable projector. Got it quickly and have been impressed with the functionality to set-up and use the device with my phone as a remote. This is basically a Bluetooth quality speaker that has a great projector in it as well. The picture quality is really good and know that I'm going to enjoy projecting movies and shows outdoors with my family this summer.",19/02/2020
Dareen,5,Worth it!,null,"I love this projector, it’s the perfect size for my room. The quality of the image and responsiveness of the remote. Even when you have the device angled, it still straightens out the video! I did have to reach out to customer service regarding Airplay compatibility, but they were very responsive. Even did a follow up to make sure my needs regarding the usage of my device was met. I’ve already been recommending this to my friends! I use a mini bendable tripod for this and it’s perfect. :)",08/12/2020
G. Ross Key,3,"Solid performance, limited apps",null,"Limited options in terms of apps. Projector performs well, but it would it would be better if it supported a wider range of streaming apps. If you want to rent movies, you're mainly stuck with Amazon. It would be great to be able to have HBO Max and Vudu. I also could not get Youtube TV to work.Picture could be brighter, otherwise good.",01/05/2021
jb2001,4,Great for a budget projector,null,"First and foremost, I like this product a lot for what it is: a portable budget projector that happens to run Android. But it’s not without its flaws, mainly being that the remote doesn’t work (despite following all the instructions in the manual and on their support forum) and to unlock its full potential you need to join their beta program for google services.Those two items aside, the projector is quite bright for its size and does well in a moderately dark room. The sound from the onboard speaker is what you would expect from a mobile device, so if you want better quality, you should pair it with speakers.Does this replace a full sized projector? No. But it’s great to have if you’re projecting against a wall in your home for like a movie night or some streaming.",24/04/2019
Greg C,3,Limited capabilities,null,"I can't get it to connect to any HDMI I plug into it. I really want to use it for my Switch. I knew it would be a long shot to use HDMI to USB C for my phone, which also won't cast the screen to it. There are comments/reviews that I say I need to contact Anker and get the code to upgrade to full Android, but can find that. Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon all work for video though.",21/07/2020
dmr,5,Works as advertised.,null,I went through 3 projectors brands before I landed on this and everything worked. Easy setup! Everything works on my iPhone I can’t get it to work on my iPad for some reason. But portable & great! It’ll eat some juice even while plugged into a power source. And it does not charge quickly. And once it disconnects from the slideshow it just keeps doing it. Odd since it stays connected to WiFi. But I love this item. And I’m still happy w/ it.,20/06/2020
IndyO,5,Awesome device for the price,null,"Only one issue is that the battery door on the remote was broken when I received it..**** BUT Anker and Amazon are working like mad to make things right!  Plus I can use my iphone to work the device anyways, so not a huge deal...  Not even sure I'd take the remote with me when traveling anyways.The sound quality is fantastic for such a small device.. Some people say the fan noise is loud but I don't find that at all.The picture blows me away, I can get over how far projectors have come in the past 4 years.I'd recommend this device to anyone looking for a quality projector!",17/12/2018
Nicole H.,2,Okay...but photos are deceiving,,"So we tried the Nebula Capsule...first off, the picture on the box shows the projector being used on a rug.  When you read the instructions, it tells you NOT to put it on a rug!  The quality is okay...it definitely needs to be very dark, and the screen quality is meh.  Sound is okay, but not great.  The nice thing is that it's not super loud like normal projectors.  Because we won't be using it much and the quality was okay, we returned it.",04/01/2019
Meghan C. Hays,3,Really expensive for what it does...plus no way to fix a crooked projection.,null,"I liked the convenience of this device, but I think it's pretty pricey for something that I have to use an HDMI cord and adapter to project Power Point presentations from my Macbook.  I really hoped it had a more ""streamlined"" (ie. wireless) ability to do this, but it appears there isn't.  It's cool that you can use it like a smart TV or Firestick with apps, etc., but that's not why I bought it.  ALSO the projection is crooked and there is NO way to fix this except to prop it up with some paper or a few tissues!  So frustrating!  Overall, I'm glad I bought it, but I'm not entirely happy with the ease or quality of the product.",23/01/2020
MaryNYC,2,"Bad picture quality, not bright, grainy at times",null,"The only thing this gets to stars for is the size it literally is the size of a soda can. The remote will physically not work when this is connected to your iPhone so i deem it useless.The brightness does not deliver even when a room is pitch black, The picture is grainy, sometimes a few large pixels appears but disappear on its own. Outdated apps. Also, this is advertised as 200 ANSI lumen, but it’s probably really in 100 - maybe 140 if I’m being generous. And the fan sound is very loud.Worth the value for the quality? Absolutely not. Will be returning.",25/05/2020
kelsey,5,Love this product!,,null,24/06/2020
Steve B.,2,Picture function and small size is impressive,null,"Loved the size and quality of the picture.  I wanted to massively like this projector but the remote and need to activate Netflix and other apps via my phone was a very poor experience.  It seemed like I would need to spend 10 minutes to get it up and running every time we wanted to use it.  Not an easy click it on and watch device.  I finally returned it to Amazon.  I would seriously be interested in the future if they fine tune this interface issue.  Unless you are really good with gadgets, which half my family is not, this is not a good choice at this time.",05/03/2021
B. Johnston,4,Great budget projector for watching tv and movies,null,"Works great for apps like Netflix and Hulu, app is very clumsy to use with YouTube, doesn’t work with Peacock and other smaller services yet The picture is great, so is sound quality. We made a “base” by cutting a slot in a toothpaste box to stabilize it when lying on its side so we can project the image on the ceiling.",04/12/2020
Dreamy,5,Great projector worth it,,I have so many Anker products it's unbelievable. They always make good sturdy stuff that is reliable. This small soda can type projector is the better than any of those big expensive projectors. The system works well in every way and fashion. The remote app that I can project my iPad or phone to it is phenomenal and the brightness of the projector is good.The battery life is so good I could watch 2 shows and have power left.I always trust Anker products regardless they are the best.,20/06/2018
Jade,4,Nice for the price,null,If you're looking for tv or movie quality image I'm not sure this your device.  The image is definitely better in a dark or in low light room.  Even so on a white wall with an overhead light on the picture isn't that bad.  I like it because it's portable.  I can use it in the bedroom or my craft room or my office.  Sound is way better than I expected.,16/09/2020
Amazon Customer,4,Great portable speaker with all the bells and whistles.,null,"This is a great little projector to take into many situations.  We got this mainly to replace a micro projector we were using in the kid's treehouse to watch movies.  We also use it as an additional to in the house if we need one, and we take it to share videos as part of the Sunday School class we teach.  The larger you project, the darker the room needs to be, but I think anything under about 50 inches does pretty well in a half-lit room.It's well built and the embedded Android system makes it extremely useable, but I highly recommend contacting Anker and getting the beta firmware with Google Store.  Otherwise the apps will be limited.  I couldn't sign into Vudu or Movies Anywhere until I upgraded to the beta firmware.  Now, every platform works great, and I am able to download several movies to the projector so I can watch them offline.This would be great for camping, small business meetings and everything in between.The focus wheel isn't as precise as I would like it to be, but because you can move the...",06/01/2019
Laurel,5,Fantastic Projector for Travel,null,"We purchased this to use as a family television while completing a transcontinental move and let me tell you, this thing came in clutch. The picture quality far surpassed our expectations and the brightness was more than adequate for our needs. The built in apps were very useful for our children (YouTube and Disney+ especially) and we were also able to connect it to our Apple TV which made the possibilities nearly endless. The focus adjust was very sensitive but it worked well. We did find it necessary to buy an adjustable gorilla stand for it. Overall, it was well worth the price tag and we will likely be purchasing other Nebula capsule in the future.",02/01/2021
Prime addict :),5,"Cinema like experience, fun family projector",,"Purchased on a whim for a planned trip/vacation to a remote cabin.We had an absolute blast as a family using the Nebula to watch Youtube videos and movies.Netflix, Kodi, Amazon etc all streamed w/ ease.

Couldn't be more pleased.And the size....really?, perfect",15/07/2018
Luciraldo,5,Amazing!!!,null,"I tried several projectors in the past few months. I started with $60 projectors until I reached this one. The quality and the size are unbeatable for this price.

MelissaB N NYC,4,Not a bad projector hopefully they fix the issues,null,The controls are a bit janky and hard to get use to. It can cast and I’ve gotten it to work for YouTube. But apps are pretty limited. I still like it for a mobile movie and tv system. And plugging my phone in is pretty simple or a laptop. But why they block casting Netflix and other apps is beyond me. If I can cast to my tv I should be able to legally cast to this or mirror.,21/06/2020
jerome a jao,5,"Incredibly Versatile, Great Quality, Upgrade the Software ASAP!",null,"This is my first review. The ideal use case for this device is projecting Netflix, Youtube, etc a 40""-50"" screen on a wall at night in a dark room, on a whim. The ""on a whim"" part is very important, because it is very easy to set up quickly - all you need is a wi-fi signal that could even be your phone's hotspot. No need for power cables, an HDMI source like a chromecast or fire stick, external speakers, or even a phone to run everything. What used to take in my situation 4 devices and 3 power outlets is reduced to a single battery powered device. This is a game changer if you are into impulsive/opportunistic viewing of videos.I highly recommend updating the software to the Beta version which will enable support of Youtube login accounts (so you can watch paid movies), HBO Go, etc.What this is not good for is if you want to watch in the morning (reserve only for toddler cartoons), or blow up the picture to 100"" (pics become very fuzzy), or if you want the best quality sound (no line out for sound, bluetoot...",30/10/2018
